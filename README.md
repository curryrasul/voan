<h3 align="center">ANonymous VOting on NEAR Protocol</h3>

___

## Motivation
One of the key requirements for votings is **privacy**. Main motivation comes from experience of participating in DAO's: you cannot vote against the proposal, because you can offend someone. Anonymity would be a great option.

---

## How it works
The protocol consists of three parts:
* Smart-contract
* Client-side app (Web-UI)
* Relayer

## Smart-contract
Smart-contract in Rust.

## Client app
Client app in JS.

## Relayer
Relayer in NodeJS

---
